Hello! I am Alejandro, a **research assistant and lecturer** at the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the University of Salamanca (Spain).  I used to work as a freelance consultant but after some time I went back to university to start a PhD. I completed my **BSc in Computer Engineering** at the University of Salamanca, from which I also obtained an **MSc in Intelligent Systems** in 2016. 

Now I am a member of the Visual Analytics Group VisUSAL (within the Recognized Research Group GRIAL), where I am currently completing my PhD thesis *"Supporting Methodology Transfer in Problem-Driven Visualization Research via Literature-Based Discovery"* under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Therón. I investigate on how **visual text analytics can accelerate problem-driven visualization research** by helping users to find **visualizations that can be reused across different knowledge domains** such as digital humanities, sports science, linguistics or bioinformatics. 

My other research interests lie in the areas of **human-computer interaction** (HCI), **design**, **statistics** and **education**. Actually, I've had the chance to **teach HCI and introduction to python programming for statisticians** at the Faculty of Sciences of Salamanca in the past, which I enjoyed a lot. Finally, and while I am not working on my thesis or research projects, I spend my time with my 2 year-old son and, sometimes, rehearsing with my reggae band.
