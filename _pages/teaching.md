description: I love teaching! I started giving private classes on signal processing and computer architecture to other graduate students when I was 22. More recently, I have been an adjunct professor at the Department of Computer Science and Automation of the University of Salamanca.

[Informática I](https://guias.usal.es/node/22074) - 1st Course Grado en Estadística (BSc in Statistics)
- This was my first teaching experience at university level.
- The course consisted in an introduction to Python programming and computional thinking for 1st year students of the BSc in Statistics.
- I prepared and imparted the [course's practical materials](https://github.com/grialusal/materiales-informatica-i).
- I conducted an evaluation of a methodology that I based on Jessica Hamricks's [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/creating_and_grading_assignments.html). Results were later presented at [JENUI 2019](https://jenui2019.inf.um.es/). [Link to paper](http://actasjenui.aenui.net/) (in Spanish).

[Interacción Persona-Ordenador](https://guias.usal.es/node/17095) - 3rd Course Grado en Ingeniería Informática (BSc in Computer Engineering)
- The course was an introduction to key HCI concepts such as evaluation, user-centered design, perception...
- I imparted the course's practical materials to ~130 students.
- As a teaching assistant, I managed the programme [Interfaces Imaginadas - El Camino de Ida y Vuelta entre la Ciencia y la Ficción](http://vis.usal.es/~interfacesimaginadas) (Imagined Interfaces - The Two-Way Trip between Science to Fiction) programme that year. This programme, created by Dr. Roberto Therón, invites students to reflect on interface design via an analysis of science fiction in TV and cinema.
