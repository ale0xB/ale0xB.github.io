  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the goals, motivations and other particularities
of a visual exploratory analysis tool for historical dictionaries of the Bavarian dialects in Austria. As an input data set we employ the digitized version of the Historical Dictionary of Bavarian Dialects in Austria (W{\"o}rterbuch der bairischen Mundarten in {\"O}sterreich or WBO), an initiative started in 1963 which compiles more than five million paper slips collected during the years 1911-1998 in different areas of current Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and northern Italy. In the 1990s these paper slips started to be progressively digitized, becoming part of the Database of Bavarian Dialects (DBO) and in 2010 nearly 32.000 records related to plant names were made available online on the DBO electronically-mapped (dbo@ema) platform. In more recent efforts, the project exploreAT!: Exploring Austria's Culture Through the Language Glass, which this work is part of, started in 2015. Its aim is ``to reveal unique insights into the rich texture of the German Language, especially in Austria, by providing state of the art tools for exploring the unique collection (1911-1998) of the Bavarian Dialects in the region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire'', and it has originated other publications in conference proceedings that we encourage the reader to review [8, 19].},

  abstract = {The world's indigenous languages and related cultural knowledge are under considerable threat of diminishing given the increasing
expansion of the use of standard languages, particularly through the wide-ranging pervasion of digital media and machine readable
editions of electronic resources. There is thus a pressing need to preserve and breathe life into traditional data resources containing both
valuable linguistic and cultural knowledge. In this paper we demonstrate on the example of an Austrian non-standard language resource
(DB{\"O}/dbo@ema), how the combined application of semantic modelling of cultural concepts and visual exploration tools are key in
unlocking the indigenous knowledge system, traditional world views and valuable cultural content contained within this rich resource.
The original data collection questionnaires serve as a pilot case study and initial access point to the entire collection. Set within a Digital
Humanities context, the collaborative methodological approach described here acts as a demonstrator for opening up traditional/nonstandard language resources for cultural content exploration through computing, ultimately giving access to, re-circulating and
preserving otherwise lost immaterial cultural heritage.},

  volume = {6},

  abstract = {As visualization becomes widespread in a broad range of cross-disciplinary academic domains, such as the digital humanities (DH), critical voices have been raised on the perils of neglecting the uncertain character of data in the visualization design process. Visualizations that, purposely or not, obscure or remove uncertainty in its different forms from the scholars\&rsquo; vision may negatively affect the manner in which humanities scholars regard computational methods as useful tools in their daily work. In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty representation in the context of the humanities from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to provide the foundations of a framework that allows for the construction of ecological interface designs which are able to expose the computational power of the algorithms at play while, at the same time, respecting the particularities and needs of humanistic research. To this end, we review past uncertainty taxonomies in other domains typically related to the humanities and visualization, such as cartography and GIScience. From this review, we select an uncertainty taxonomy related to the humanities that we link to recent research in visualization for the DH. Finally, we bring a novel analytics method developed by other authors (Progressive Visual Analytics) into question, which we argue can be a good candidate to resolve the aforementioned difficulties in DH practice.},

Even in non data-oriented cases, analysts and other stakeholders need to make decisions without being aware of the level of uncertainty associated to the data being transformed by the computational tools used to enable the kind of novel work of humanists pursued within DH. We examine in this paper the literature that have characterized the types and sources of uncertainty in other fields, with the intent of establishing a foundation upon which build novel computational tools supporting the decision-making under uncertainty processes that DH is currently facing. We propose the use of progressive visual analytics as a feasible means to manage decision-making under uncertainty, which may help tackling some challenges related to the elimination or mitigation of uncertainty in DH, that otherwise would tamper the quality of the yielded results.},

We used geospatial data acquired from a professional match to demonstrate its capabilities in two different case studies. Furthermore, we successfully proved the efficiency of the different visualization techniques implemented in the prototype and demonstrated how visual analysis can effectively improve some of the basic tasks employed by sports experts on their daily work, complementing more traditional approaches.},

Retrieving and understanding data from triplestores (such as SPARQL) requires technical knowledge and proves to be challenging with large datasets, which result in an increase in the mental overload when unknown ontologies are involved in the creation of complex queries. These two problems benefit greatly from visual techniques that allow for executing them in an easier and more intuitive manner. These techniques have already been applied to each problem separately; however, we propose combining them to lower the complexity of triple-store data retrieval and empower its exploration and analysis through specific data visualizations. To demonstrate the suitability of this strategy, a web-based tool was implemented. It allows for the creation of interactive queries using node-link ontology representations, and a subsequent filtering and analysis through a configurable dashboard with different data visualizations. This paper also presents a user-centred design process and evaluation of the proposed tool.},

This fruitful collaboration is attracting researchers from other areas of science who may be willing to create visual analysis tools that promote humanities research in its many forms. However, as the collaboration grows in complexity, it may become intimidating for these scholars to get engaged in the discipline. To facilitate this task, we have built an introduction to visualization for the digital humanities that sits on a data-driven stance adopted by the authors. In order to construct a dataset representative of the discipline, we analyze citations from on a core corpus on 300 publications in visualization for the humanities obtained from recent editions of the InfoVis Vis4DH workshop, the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference, and the specialized DH journal Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ). From here, we extract referenced works and analyze more than 1,900 publications in search of citation patterns, prominent authors in the field, and other interesting insights. Finally, following the path set by other researchers in the visualization and HCI communities, we analyze paper keywords to identify significant themes and research opportunities in the field.},
