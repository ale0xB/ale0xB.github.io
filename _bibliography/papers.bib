As an input data set we employ the digitized version of the Historical Dictionary of Bavarian Dialects in Austria (W\"orterbuch der bairischen Mundarten in \"Osterreich or WBO), an initiative started in 1963 which compiles more than five million paper slips collected during the years 1911-1998 in different areas of current Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and northern Italy. In the 1990s these paper slips started to be progressively digitized, becoming part of the Database of Bavarian Dialects (DBO) and in 2010 nearly 32.000 records related to plant names were made available online on the DBO electronically-mapped (dbo@ema) platform. In more recent efforts, the project exploreAT!: Exploring Austria's Culture Through the Language Glass, which this work is part of, started in 2015. Its aim is ``to reveal unique insights into the rich texture of the German Language, especially in Austria, by providing state of the art tools for exploring the unique collection (1911-1998) of the Bavarian Dialects in the region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire'', and it has originated other publications in conference proceedings that we encourage the reader to review [8, 19].},

Evolution of technology allows collection of in-creasingly larger and more specific data sets related to sport activities in cost-effective and accessible manner. All this information is minutely scrutinized by thousands of analysts around the globe in search of an-swers that can in the long term help increase the performance of indi-viduals or teams in their respective competitions. As the volume of data increases in size, so does the complexity of the problem and the need for suitable tools that leverage the cognitive load involved in the inves-tigation. It is proven that visualization and computer-vision techniques, correctly applied to the context of a problem, help data analysts focus on the relevant information at each stage of the process, and generally lead to a better understanding of the facts that lie behind the data. In the current study, we presented a software prototype capable of assisting researchers and performance analysts in their duty of studying group collective behavior in soccer games and trainings. We used geospatial data acquired from a professional match to demonstrate its capabilities in two different case studies. Furthermore, we successfully proved the efficiency of the different visualization techniques implemented in the prototype and demonstrated how visual analysis can effectively improve some of the basic tasks employed by sports experts on their daily work, complementing more traditional approaches.},

This fruitful collaboration is attracting researchers from other areas of science who may be willing to create visual analysis tools that promote humanities research in its many forms. However, as the collaboration grows in complexity, it may become intimidating for these scholars to get engaged in the discipline. To facilitate this task, we have built an introduction to visualization for the digital humanities that sits on a data-driven stance adopted by the authors. In order to construct a dataset representative of the discipline, we analyze citations from a core corpus on 300 publications in visualization for the humanities obtained from recent editions of the InfoVis Vis4DH workshop, the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference, and the specialized digital humanities journal Digital Humanities Quarterly. From here, we extract referenced works and analyze more than 1900 publications in search of citation patterns, prominent authors in the field, and other interesting insights. Finally, following the path set by other researchers in the visualization and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) communities, we analyze paper keywords to identify significant themes and research opportunities in the field.},

This is the case of problem-driven visualization research (PDVR), in which groups of scholars use visualization techniques in different application domains such as the digital humanities, bioinformatics, sports science, or computer security. In this paper, we employ the findings obtained during the development of a novel visual text analytics tool we built in previous studies, GlassViz, to automatically detect interesting knowledge associations and groups of common interests between these communities of practice. Our proposed method relies on the statistical modeling of author-assigned keywords to make its findings, which are demonstrated in two use cases. The results show that it is possible to propose interactive, semisupervised visual approaches that aim at defragmenting a body of research using text-based, automatic literature analysis methods.},

In this paper we demonstrate on the example of an Austrian non-standard language resource (DB\"O/dbo@ema), how the combined application of semantic modelling of cultural concepts and visual exploration tools are key in unlocking the indigenous knowledge system, traditional world views and valuable cultural content contained within this rich resource. The original data collection questionnaires serve as a pilot case study and initial access point to the entire collection. Set within a Digital Humanities context, the collaborative methodological approach described here acts as a demonstrator for opening up traditional/nonstandard language resources for cultural content exploration through computing, ultimately giving access to, re-circulating and preserving otherwise lost immaterial cultural heritage.},

Retrieving and understanding data from triplestores (such as SPARQL) requires technical knowledge and proves to be challenging with large datasets, which result in an increase in the mental overload when unknown ontologies are involved in the creation of complex queries. These two problems benefit greatly from visual techniques that allow for executing them in an easier and more intuitive manner. These techniques have already been applied to each problem separately; however, we propose combining them to lower the complexity of triple-store data retrieval and empower its exploration and analysis through specific data visualizations. To demonstrate the suitability of this strategy, a web-based tool was implemented. It allows for the creation of interactive queries using node-link ontology representations, and a subsequent filtering and analysis through a configurable dashboard with different data visualizations. This paper also presents a user-centred design process and evaluation of the proposed tool.},

Visualizations that, purposely or not, obscure or remove uncertainty in its different forms from the scholars\&rsquo; vision may negatively affect the manner in which humanities scholars regard computational methods as useful tools in their daily work. In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty representation in the context of the humanities from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to provide the foundations of a framework that allows for the construction of ecological interface designs which are able to expose the computational power of the algorithms at play while, at the same time, respecting the particularities and needs of humanistic research. To this end, we review past uncertainty taxonomies in other domains typically related to the humanities and visualization, such as cartography and GIScience. From this review, we select an uncertainty taxonomy related to the humanities that we link to recent research in visualization for the DH. Finally, we bring a novel analytics method developed by other authors (Progressive Visual Analytics) into question, which we argue can be a good candidate to resolve the aforementioned difficulties in DH practice.},

Even in non data-oriented cases, analysts and other stakeholders need to make decisions without being aware of the level of uncertainty associated to the data being transformed by the computational tools used to enable the kind of novel work of humanists pursued within DH. We examine in this paper the literature that have characterized the types and sources of uncertainty in other fields, with the intent of establishing a foundation upon which build novel computational tools supporting the decision-making under uncertainty processes that DH is currently facing.
